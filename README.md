Monster Hunt Game made with Python and Pygame.ðŸ‘¾

- Description: Monsters are randomly moving and bouncing off. Your hunter can move back and forth in the safe zone.
Once it enters the arena, it won't be able to come back down to this safe zone. You have a current target monster that you have to hunt down and if you hunt down the correct monster, you capture it, earn the points and then the monster changes. If you hunt down the wrong monster, you lose a life and you go back down to the starting point.
If you see that you are about to collide with the wrong monster, you can hit spacebar (as long as you have the correct amount of warps) to warp back down to the safe zone. If you catch all monsters, it goes to the next round and then it repopulates the game with even more monsters and you will get lives + 1 and warps + 1.
